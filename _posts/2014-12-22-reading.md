![Hemingway and JavaScript](/images/posts/hemingway.png)

If you're lucky enough to be enjoying a festive holiday right now, then you're probably starting to get bored of Christmas movies and long dark teatimes of the soul.  Rather than knuckling down with the family to watch Elf for the umpteenth time, why not load up your favourite reading device with some programming books and articles?

Angus Croll sent in a copy of his book [If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript](http://anguscroll.com/hemingway/) ([No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com/hemingwayjs), $15.95), which makes comparisons between literary figures and programming styles.  This book started as a blog post about Hemingway, and there are amusing posts on his blog, like [Animals writing JavaScript](http://blog.anguscroll.com/animals_writing_javascript).  I thought it would be hard to stretch the original idea out into an entire book, but Angus uses the concept to explore the broader question of how we write and think about JavaScript:

> JavaScript has plenty in common with natural language. It is at its most expressive when combining simple idioms in original ways; its syntax, which is limited yet flexible, promotes innovation without compromising readability. And, like natural language, it's ready to write. Some of JavaScript's more baroque cousins must be edited with an IDE (integrated development environmentâ€”a sort of Rube Goldberg machine for coding). JavaScript needs nothing more than a text file and an open mind.

The question of style in programming is usually approached with defensive trepidation, but the literary conceit allows Angus to present different stylistic ideas without judging them.  For example, Virginia Woolf's poetic stream of consciousness is recreated with a mix of long lines and flexible use of semicolons:

> If the semicolon is the period of JavaScript, then the comma operator is its semicolon. Programmer Woolf loves the comma operator, and in her happy numbers solution, she uses it to excess. The result is a dreamy, melancholic form of JavaScript (is there any other?) made dreamier still by the heavy, almost dangerous level of n alliteration and some gorgeously expressive pairings. In To the Lighthouse, Woolf writes of night's shadows: "They lengthen; they darken"; in her happy numbers solution we get the wistfully poetic `numerals.shift()`, `numerals.length`.

I commute across London everyday and read to pass the time.  Over the years I've moved from pulp sci-fi to 20th century modernists and the classics, so this book is ideal for me.  I'm not sure how many literary programmers there are, however, so this is definitely a novelty that I will cherish.

Other readers have also recently sent in some interesting resources that you might like to read over the holiday.  Thai Pangsakulyanont's [JavaScript for Automation Cookbook](https://github.com/dtinth/JXA-Cookbook/wiki) contains examples for Apple's new scripting system that allows you to control Yosemite applications with JavaScript.  It includes iTunes, Safari, system events, and how to use CommonJS modules with Browserify, so you can actually make maintainable automation scripts.

Eugene Abrosimov sent in [a big list of Backbone.js tutorials, articles, videos, and examples](https://github.com/instanceofpro/awesome-backbone).  There should be a few things on there to load up Instapaper/Pocket if you use Backbone.

And, just over a week ago I received the first print of my book, [Node.js in Practice](http://manning.com/young/) (Manning, $39.99).  I wrote it with Marc Harter, and we've designed the book for intermediate to advanced Node developers.  Our publisher, Manning, also publishes [Node.js in Action](http://www.manning.com/cantelon/) (Manning, $35.99) which is well suited to new Node programmers.
