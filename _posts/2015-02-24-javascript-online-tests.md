Hiring programmers is hard work.  Finding candidates takes time, and then figuring out if they've really got the right skills can be tricky as well.  I've done technical tests as part of interviews before, and some have actually been enjoyable, but most have been quite poorly conducted.  [Tests for Geeks](https://tests4geeks.com) is a service that aims to improve the technical testing process, by providing high-quality tests with reports that are easier for recruiters to understand, and tests that programmers can undertake and attach to their CVs.

Tests are timed, and the default JavaScript test is designed to take 45 minutes.  There are some rules: you can't press any keys or copy questions, and it tries to discourage candidates from circumventing these rules.  If the candidate attempts to press any keys they'll see a prompt warning them -- then the test can be continued by pressing a button.

There's a [JavaScript online test](https://tests4geeks.com/test/javascript) that includes questions that would be useful for testing client-side developers.  Your HR manager or recruiter can easily create unique links to send to candidates.  Because there are so many JavaScript tools and frameworks, you might find this test works well for judging a candidate's general JavaScript skills.

To actually test candidates, you'll need a paid plan.  Plans start at $29.95 for three tests, but you can buy unlimited tests for a month for $99.95.  If you were looking to hire someone quickly and had lots of applicants, then naturally the unlimited plan would make sense.  Also, the paid plans support custom branding, so you can use your own domain name and logo.  Tests for Geeks have many other programming tests and the last one which they launched was [iOS and Objective-C test](https://tests4geeks.com/test/ios-objective-c).

One thing I like about Tests for Geeks is the recruiters I've worked with before can easily understand the reports.  The coding test reports explicitly show the strength in each area, so if they've got better knowledge of the DOM you should see that on the report with a higher ranking.  This is what the report looks like:

I've seen a few online test sites before, but this is the first one that I've used that is specifically designed for technical tests.  If you haven't done a technical test before then you might like to try it out, or you could even create some new questions.

Many thanks to _Tests for Geeks_ for sponsoring DailyJS!
