###ReactShadow

If you use React but would rather put CSS in separate files, then now you can with Adam Timberlake's ReactShadow (GitHub: [Wildhoney/ReactShadow]( https://github.com/Wildhoney/ReactShadow), License: _MIT_, npm: [react-shadow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-shadow), Bower: `react-shadow`).

> With ReactShadow you can apply a Shadow DOM root inside of your component. Under normal React.js conditions, your styles are written inline for style encapsulation – with ReactShadow your styles can now be moved into their rightful place – within CSS documents!

There's a [demo of ReactShadow](http://react-shadow.herokuapp.com/) that displays a few simple `section` elements that are styled using CSS files. The files specific to each section are loaded with `@import` using `style` elements. This works by declaring a `cssDocuments` property on the relevant react classes.  It seems easy to use and potentially better than using inline styles, particularly if you've got existing stylesheets.

###npm Subreddit

Daniel Bugl sent me [reddit.com/r/npm](https://www.reddit.com/r/npm), a subreddit all about Node modules. I receive lots of Node modules to write about on DailyJS but I don't have time to cover everything, so it's a good idea to post them places like this as well.

Another good way to promote your modules is [EchoJS](http://www.echojs.com/).  I find it useful for getting a shapshot of the community right now -- recently it's all been about the Node/io.js drama.

You should always share your JavaScript projects. The old adage "if you build it they will come" is complete nonsense, don't be afraid to promote things you've worked hard on!
