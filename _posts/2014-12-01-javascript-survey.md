Here is the [JavaScript Developer Survey for 2014](http://goo.gl/forms/Fl8xcmwPtM)!  You have two weeks from now to complete the survey (the 15th of December).

I asked for help with the questions [last year](http://dailyjs.com/2013/11/21/developer-survey/), and collected pull requests and issues to improve the survey.  You can view the survey repository at [alexyoung/dailyjs-survey](https://github.com/alexyoung/dailyjs-survey).  Many thanks to everyone who has helped so far.

Please fill out the survey and **share it with your fellow JavaScript programmers**!  I make sure the data is open so it's not just used for planning DailyJS content, you can use it as well.
