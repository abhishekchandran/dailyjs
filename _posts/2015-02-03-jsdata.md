Asaf Katz sent in JSData (GitHub: [js-data/js-data](https://github.com/js-data/js-data), License: _MIT_, npm: [js-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-data), Bower: `js-data`) by Jason Dobry, a model layer for caching data.  It supports adapters for sending data to persistence layers, so you can install DSHttpAdapter (npm/Bower: `js-data-http`) to send data to a REST server or DSLocalStorageAdapter (npm/Bower: `js-data-localstorage`) for browser-based storage.  There are even adapters for RethinkDB, Firebase, and Redis.

One nice thing about JSData is it uses `Object.observe` to watch for changes to data, so it doesn't need any special getters or setters.  It also supports promises, so you can use `then` after finding or inserting data.

It also has more advanced ORM-style features like relations, computed properties, lifecycle methods, and data validation.  The schema and validation API isn't based on JSON-Schema, but it has the kinds of features you've probably seen in other ORMs and ODMs like Mongoose:

{% highlight javascript %}
var store = new JSData.DS();

var User = store.defineResource({
  name: 'user',
  schema: {
    id: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      maxLength: 255
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      nullable: false
    }
  }
});

User.create({
  name: 'John'
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Email errors will be in err.email.errors
});
{% endhighlight %}

This is an example I adapted from the [Schemata and Validation](http://www.js-data.io/v1.0.0-beta.1/docs/schemata--validation) documentation.

JSData was originally written for AngularJS, but is now framework-agnostic.  However, there is an [Angular integration guide](http://www.js-data.io/v1.0.0-beta.1/docs/js-data-angular) which shows how it can be used with Angular applications.

Because JSData can be used with Node and browsers, you could use it to define reusable models for single-page apps that sync when the server is available.  It'll also work well if you're used to Rails-inspired frameworks like Ember, and you're used to working with fat models that include data validation and lifecycle methods.
