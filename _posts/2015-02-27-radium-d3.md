###Radium

Ken Wheeler sent in [Radium](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/) (GitHub: [FormidableLabs/radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium), License: _MIT_, npm: [radium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/radium)) from Formidable Labs.  Radium is a module for managing inline styles on React elements, allowing you to use CSS features that aren't usually possible with inline styles.

You can use modifier styles based on component props, media queries, and handle pseudo classes.

> Radium offers a standard interface and abstractions for dealing with these problems.

Radium provides a mixin called `StyleResolverMixin` which will generate the styles that you want to add to a component.  The style objects it uses look like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var radStyles = {
  padding: '1.5em',
  border: 0,
  borderRadius: 4,
  background: 'blue',
  color: 'white'
};
{% endhighlight %}

You can then call `this.buildStyles` in the `render` method, and add the styles to the `style` attribute.  Radium also supports modifiers -- CSS properties that are applied based on the component's props and state.  Take a look at the [getting started guide](https://github.com/formidablelabs/radium/blob/master/docs/guides/overview.md) to learn more.

Ken also mentioned [React: CSS in JS by Christopher Chedeau](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js), who works at Facebook in the front-end infrastructure team.

###React D3 Components

![React 3D Components](/images/posts/reactd3charts.png)

[react-d3-components](https://github.com/codesuki/react-d3-components) (GitHub: [codesuki/react-d3-components](https://github.com/codesuki/react-d3-components), License: _MIT_, npm: [react-d3-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-components)) by Neri Marschik is a library for working with D3 in React.  Imagine being able to include elements like `BarChart` in your `render` methods, which generates charts based on the `ReactD3.BarChart` class.

You can even add tooltips and CSS classes. The project's readme includes lots of charts, but not every D3 chart is supported yet.  The author is also working on animations.

I much prefer the idea of giving D3 charts some added structure with React -- usually my D3 code ends up a little bit on the less maintainable side!
