There's a library for Meteor called [Asteroid](https://github.com/mondora/asteroid) that allows you to connect any JavaScript front-end to a Meteor server.  That means you can use Meteor with existing applications, or your preferred front-end framework.

Attila Csipa has created a new library called Qondrite (GitHub: [achipa/Qondrite](https://github.com/achipa/Qondrite), License: _MIT_) that is a QML wrapper for Asteroid.  QML, or the Qt Meta Language, is a declarative markup language based on JavaScript for creating mobile applications.  It's used by KDE Plasma 5 and Unity.

Qondrite allows you to create Qt projects with Meteor backends.  This seems like an ideal way to make an open source version of something like [Parse](https://parse.com/), where you get a simple server-side system that has mobile support.  I've never written any QML myself, but I'd be interested to see if [Qt for iOS](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/ios-support.html) could be used with Qondrite.

Attila has posted a video where you can see the library in action: [Meteor and Qt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9KqDrqYRsc).  If you want to install the library, take a look at the installation details in the readme.  There's also a [demo application](https://github.com/achipa/outqross_blog/tree/master/3_OutQross.Meteor_demo) with a small QML file:

{% highlight javascript %}
import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
  Loader {
    id: mainWindow
  }

  Component.onCompleted: {
    if (Qt.platform.os === "android")
      mainWindow.setSource("Android.qml")
    else
      mainWindow.setSource("Desktop.qml")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how it forks for [Android](https://github.com/achipa/outqross_blog/blob/master/3_OutQross.Meteor_demo/Android.qml) or desktop.  This is also reminiscent of [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).
