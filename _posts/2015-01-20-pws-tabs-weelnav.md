###PWS Tabs

PWS Tabs (GitHub: [alexchizhovcom/pwstabs](https://github.com/alexchizhovcom/pwstabs), License: _MIT_) by Alex Chizhov is a jQuery plugin that helps you create modern, flat tabs, with CSS3 animations and Font Awesome Icons.

It uses `data-` attributes to set the tab's title and icon.  The `$(selector).pwstabs` method accepts options for the tab position (horizontal or vertical) and the animation effect name.

The plugin source itself is fairly leightweight, and it comes with examples that include CSS.  When I reviewed this plugin I had to download the examples because I couldn't access Alex's site, but he does link to a live demo in the readme.

###wheelnav.js

[wheelnav.js](http://wheelnavjs.softwaretailoring.net/index.html) by Gábor Berkesi is an SVG-based library that you can use for a centerpiece animated navigation component.  This might work well for a marketing website, which is the example Gábor uses, but I think it would be really cool on a child-friendly site with lots of bright colours site as well.

The licensing is mixed -- there are free versions but also [more advanced paid versions](http://bootstrapachka.softwaretailoring.net/wheelizate/tabs/index.html).

A good example of the library can be found [on the download page](http://wheelnavjs.softwaretailoring.net/download.html), which ties a spinning component in with some tabbed navigation.
