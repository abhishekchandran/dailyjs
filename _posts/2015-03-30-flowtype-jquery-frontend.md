###Flow

If you like strongly typed languages, then there are more options than ever for JavaScript.  Other than TypeScript, a major new tool is [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) (GitHub: [facebook/flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow), License: _BSD_) from Facebook.  Flow allows you to annotate code with comments to get type checking -- this is known as weak mode.  You can also use real type annotations, which means you'll have to use the Flow transpiler to deploy code.

Flow is written with OCaml, and it's available through the OPAM package manager (`opam install flowtype`).

If you want type checking without completely changing JavaScript, then you may like TypeScript.  There's even a [Flux and React demo](http://flowtype.org/docs/react-example.html#_):

> In this case study, we take an existing React project and attempt to have Flow be able to successfully type check its code. While it will not be an automatic, run the Flow type-checker only one time win, we will show that it does not need to be painful to use Flow on your existing projects.

###You Gotta Love Frontend Conference

The [You Gotta Love Frontend Conference](http://yougottalovefrontend.com/) is being held in Tel Aviv from June 8th through to June 9th, 2015.  Tickets are available from 750 NIS, which is about $190.  The speakers include Douglas Crockford, Lea Verou, and Martin Kleppe, so it sounds like it'll be worth attending!

###jQuery Conference: San Francisco
