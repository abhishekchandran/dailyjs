A few years ago, Firefox and Chrome added support for styles to log messages.  This means you can call `console.log` with an additional CSS option.  I've noticed a few libraries and frameworks using this to good effect for debugging messages, but an idea that's new to me is combining Markdown with logging.

[Logdown](http://caiogondim.github.io/logdown/) (GitHub: [caiogondim/logdown](https://github.com/caiogondim/logdown), License: _MIT_, npm: [logdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logdown)) by Caio Gondim is a module that lets you include Markdown in logs for both the browser and server.  It can do the basics, like italic and bold, but the thing that I really like is including code.

To use it, instantiate a new `Logdown` instance, and then just log as you would with `console.log`:

{% highlight javascript %}
var Logdown = require('logdown');
var debug = new Logdown({ prefix: 'foo' });

debug.log('lorem *ipsum*');
debug.info('dolor _sit_ amet');
debug.warn('consectetur `adipiscing` elit');
{% endhighlight %}

The module supports various options: you can turn off Markdown parsing and add a prefix.  It supports Node 0.10+, io.js 1.0+; and Chrome, Firefox, IE 9+, Opera, and Safari 8.0+.
